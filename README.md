Complete and accurate clinical documentation is crucial for monitoring patient care. Physicians are tasked with documentation of clinic visit, but the traditional methods of a physician manually writing a report have led to their increased workload, reduced interaction time with patients, and a diminished work-life balance.

Therefore, this project employs Huggingface's Falconsai T5 transformer model to summarize clinical patient reports.

### Dataset
This model is trained on the Huggingface dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/owkin/medical_knowledge_from_extracts.
